# CommScope-Yield Dashboard for all Product-Lines 

### Issue: <br> The manual process of collecting and analyzing data was a significant challenge for the global team of senior engineers/ NPI Engineers, as it made it difficult for them to gain visual insights and compare metrics from different locations. This could have led to a lack of understanding about the performance of different product lines and regions, as well as a lack of visibility into potential issues or opportunities for improvement  

### Impact: <br> By creating an automated system showing dashboard in Power BI and using direct queries within PowerBI to connect with the MQSQL Server database, the team was able to overcome these challenges and gain real-time visibility into key metrics. This allowed them to easily compare performance across different locations and product lines, identify areas of strength and weakness, and make informed decisions to improve efficiency and profitability.

as it allowed them to easily access and compare metrics from different locations and product lines in one place. By automating the process of gathering and analyzing data, the team was able to save a significant amount of time and effort that was previously spent on manual data collection

In addition, the creation of the dashboard allowed upper management to make more informed decisions, as they were able to view and analyze key metrics in real-time. This could potentially lead to improved efficiency and profitability for the business unit.

Overall, it sounds like this project was a success and provided a valuable tool for the global team to better understand their product performance and make data-driven decisions.
